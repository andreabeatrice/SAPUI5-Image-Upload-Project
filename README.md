## image-upload-project

First a user uploads an image, and it is cropped to the focus point by the Microsoft API. They are then given a chance to adjust the image. Once they press "Upload", the image is sent to the Microsoft Face API, which checks if the user is wearing glasses/sunglasses, and how easily recognizable they are in the photo. If the quality for recognition is less than "high" or the photo doesn't meet one of the other requirements, it's not uploaded. Otherwise, it is accepted as the new profile picture, which is shown the the demo by placing it next to the image editor. When we tested it, we found that the Face API sometimes struggles with recognizing dark-skinned black women and that it also doesn't always accept images where women are wearing face coverings for religious purposes (like niqabs) so we've added a link to request a manual reviewâ€”it doesn't currently do anything, but it would probably end up being a mailto link to someone who has the permissions to change profile pictures without going through this process.
